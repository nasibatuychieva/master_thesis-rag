The battery is charged while the minimum input voltage to X1 is met. The MPM3550EGLE (U6) provides a +5V rail to power the peripherals. This IC also provides power to the BQ24195RGET IC (U11) that manages the Li-ion battery and boosts the voltage to +5V. U11 also determines the battery status.\nThe power source can be determined by querying the System Status Register of U11 and check the PG_STAT field. PG_STAT = 1 means the board is powered with a power source on VBUS. Please refer to the IC datasheet for further details.\nPriority is with the jack delivered power. The battery charger IC also outputs a +3V8 power rail that powers the modem (U1). The +5V power rail provides power to the Portenta board that regulates the voltage with its onboard buck converter to +3V3. The +3V3 power rail supplies power to the LoRa module (U23), 4-port USB hub (U3), microSD module (J11) and Fieldbus circuitry (U4). Audio is powered by a dedicated AP7311 LDO regulator that provides a low noise +1V8 power rail.\nThe debugger circuitry has a dedicated power supply AP2112K (U14) that runs off the micro USB voltage from J10. This enables the debugger to operate even if the Portenta board is not inserted.\nVoltage range and max current are provided as a general guideline only.
