For the EMR variant, eight powerful 6 A electromechanical relays capable of actuating on loads at a rated voltage of 250 VAC and up to a maximum switching voltage of 400 VAC, and for the SSR variant, eight fast 3 A solid state relays which are capable of actuating on DC loads at a rated voltage of 24 VDC.\nThe relay Maximum Peak Current is defined as the highest value of inrush current that the relay can endure without undergoing any permanent degradation of its characteristics due to the generated heat. The relay has to be able to hold up that maximum using a duty cycle of less or equal to 10% and for a time equal to or less than 0.5 s.\nIn the case of Arduino Opta® Digital Expansions, the EMR and SSR variants have a Maximum Peak Current of 10 A and 50 A respectively.\nThe Rated Load is the maximum resistive load that a contact can make, carry and break repeatedly.\n- For resistive or slightly inductive loads (AC1 classification), EMR variant's Rated Load is 1500 VA.\n- For small electromagnetic loads (> 72 VA) (AC15 classification) like power contactors, magnetic solenoid valves, electromagnets and AC single-phase supplies, EMR variant's Rated Load is 300 VA. This value assumes a peak inrush current of approximately 10 times the rated current and keeps it within the maximum peak current.\nFor controlling DC loads (DC1 classification), the EMR variant's Breaking Capacity or maximum value of DC resistive current that a contact can make, carry and break repeatedly, is 6/0.2/0.12 A for respectively 24/110/220 V.\nFor controlling DC electromagnetics loads (DC13 classification), the SSR variant's Rated Load is 36 W.\nIn the case of the minimum switching load parameters, the minimum values of power, voltage and current that the EMR variant relays can reliably switch, are 500 mW/ 12 V / 10 mA. This implies that with 12 V the current must be at least 42 mA, with 24 V, it must be at least 21 mA, and with 10 mA the voltage must be at least 50V.\nFor the SSR variant , the minimum switching voltage and current are 1.5 VDC and 1 mA respectively.\nThe EMR variant relays on Arduino Opta® Digital Expansions provide a very fast response time of 6/4 ms to change state for closing/reopening. The SSR variant provides an even faster response of 0.02/0.2 ms to change state for closing/reopening.", "total_chunks": 32}

When the channels are configured as inputs they can be used as digital ones with a 0-24/0-10 V range, or analog being able to measure voltage from 0 to 10 V, measure current from 0 to 25 mA or temperature leveraging the RTD mode.\nThe channels I1 and I2 can be used for connecting 3-Wires RTDs. Every channel can be used also as an output, be aware that using more than two channels as an output simultaneously may overheat the device. This will depend on the ambient temperature and channel load.\nWe have tested setting all eight channels as outputs at 25 °C outputting more than 24 mA at 10 V each during a limited timeframe.\nWarning: In case the user needs a configuration with a deviation from the suggested one, will need to validate the system performance and stability before a deployment into a production environment.\nThe PWM outputs are software configurable and for them to work you must provide the V PWM pin with the desired voltage between 8 and 24 VDC, you can set the period and duty-cycle by software.", "total_chunks": 37}
