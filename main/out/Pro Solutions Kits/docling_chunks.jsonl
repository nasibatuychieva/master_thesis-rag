Get real-time insight into the state of your process and increase crop yield. Improve business efficiency through automation and predictive farming. Tailor the Edge Control to your needs by using up two Arduino® MKR Boards and an assortment of compatible Shields. Maintain historical records, automate quality control, implement crop planning and more through the Arduino Cloud from anywhere in the world.\nAutomated Greenhouses: In order to minimize carbon emissions and increase economic yield, it is important to ensure that the best environment is provided for the growth of crops in terms of humidity, temperature and other factors. The Arduino® Edge Control is an integrated platform that enables remote monitoring and real-times optimization to this end. Including an Arduino® MKR GPS Shield (SKU:ASX00017) allows for optimum crop rotation planning and acquisition of geospatial data.\nHydroponics/Aquaponics: Since hydroponics involves the growth of plants without soil, delicate care must be maintained to ensure they maintain the narrow window required for optimum growth. The Arduino Edge Control can ensure that this window is achieved with minimal manual labour. Aquaponics can provide even more benefits than conventional hydroponics towards which the Arduino® Edge Control can help match the even higher requirements by providing better control over the internal process while ultimately reducing production risks.\nMushroom Cultivation: Mushrooms are notorious for requiring the perfect temperature and humidity conditions to sustain spore growth while also preventing competing fungi from growing. Thanks to the numerous watermark sensors, output ports and connectivity options available on the Arduino® Edge Control as well as the Arduino® IoT Cloud, this precision farming can be achieved on an unprecedented level.", "total_chunks": 45}
