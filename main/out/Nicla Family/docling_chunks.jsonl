Deploy predictive maintenance, gesture and speech recognition, and contactless applications in a miniaturized form factor. A 6-axis motion sensor, a magnetometer, and always-on speech recognition on the edge are at your disposal for unrestricted research and development. On-board Bluetooth® Low Energy connectivity grants interoperability with compatible Nicla, Portenta, and MKR devices for scalability. Ultra-low power consumption enables long lasting device life-time and wide range of deployment possibilities.\n- Automated Intruder Detection System : Nicla Voice's edge capabilities enable faster identification of critical and time-sensitive events, including glass-breaking or motion sensing. Multiple voices, sound and sensor applications can run simultaneously with low power consumption, all in a tiny battery-powered size, allowing long periods of usage without intervention.\n- Predictive Maintenance : Nicla Voice can be used to predict the wear of industrial equipment, machinery and automation devices. It can detect vibrations, noises coming from motors or coils and gather the information needed for the Neural Decision Network to align maintenance with the operational characteristics.\n- Add low-power speech recognition : With the built-in microphone and its tiny form factor, you can easily equip an existing setup with the Nicla Voice to improve the workflow by adding speech recognition like voice commands. Moreover, an always-on speech recognition application can be developed thanks to the ultra lowpower Syntiant® NDP120 Neural Decision Processor™.", "total_chunks": 51}

The board can function as a field-ready standalone board or be extended with external peripherals through the I/O available on the chip. Ultra-low power consumption and integrated battery management allow for deployment in various capabilities. WebBLE allows for easy OTA updates to the firmware as well as remote monitoring.\n- Warehouse & Automated Inventory Management : The Arduino Nicla Vision can detect packages as they approach and activate accordingly. This provides the benefits of an always-on camera with reduced power consumption. It can take pictures, estimate volume/weight, and check for potential defects. Package QR codes can also be tracked for automated follow-up and data transmission to the Cloud.\n- Real-time process management : The Arduino Nicla Vision is well-suited for Automated Optical Inspection (AOI), even in challenging or hazardous environments, thanks to the small footprint and wireless connectivity options. The fast Time-of-Flight sensor ensures consistent image capture with minimal impact on the process. Additionally, the IMU can provide vibration analysis for predictive maintenance purposes.\n- Wireless Sensor Network Reference Design : The Nicla form factor has been specifically developed at Arduino® as a standard for wireless sensor networks, allowing partners to build custom industrial solutions. Researchers and educators can use this platform to work on an industrially recognized standard in wireless sensor research and development, helping to reduce the time from concept to market.", "total_chunks": 49}
