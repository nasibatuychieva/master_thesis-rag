Featuring a 9 axis inertial measurement unit and the possibility for Bluetooth® Low Energy connectivity it can help you to create your next Bluetooth® Low Energy enabled project.\nGet Started\nNano 33 BLE\nDownloadable resources\nPinout (PDF)\nDatasheet\nSchematics\nFritzing Files\nCAD Files\nThe Arduino Nano 33 BLE is a great choice for any beginner, maker or professional to get started with Bluetooth® Low Energy enabled projects. It is build upon the nRF52840 microcontroller and runs on Arm® Mbed™ OS. The Nano 33 BLE not only features the possibility to connect via BLE but also comes equipped with a 9 axis IMU making it suitable for wearable projects.\nBluetooth®\nBluetooth®\nA powerful 2.4 GHz Bluetooth® 5 Low Energy module from u-blox, with an internal antenna. Can be used to transmit data between different devices using the ArduinoBLE library.\nDocumentation\nLibrary\nIMU\nIMU for Motion Detection\nThe LSM9DS1 inertial measurement unit features a 3D accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer allowing you to detect orientation, motion or vibrations in your project.\nDocumentation\nLibrary\nPython\nPython® Support\nThis board can be programmed using MicroPython, which is an implementation of the Python® programming language that comes with a subset of the Python® standard library.\nDocumentation\nLearn More\nCore\nArm® Mbed™ OS\nArm® Mbed™ OS is an open-source operating system which the Nano 33 BLE builds upon. It’s the same operating system as the Arduino Portenta H7, which allows for Arduino APIs to be integrated using APIs exposed directly by Mbed OS.\nDocumentation\nCertifications\nConnect and Contribute\nProject HubGitHub RepositoryForum\nProduct ComplianceHelp CenterTrademarks & Licensing\nWas this article helpful?", "meta": {"doc_id": "documents/Nano Family/Nano 33 BLE/Nano 33 BLE _ Arduino Documentation.html", "pages": [], "section_path": [], "source": "html", "doc_type": "tutorial", "product_family": "Nano Family", "product": "Nano 33 BLE", "tutorial_type": null, "rel_path": "documents/Nano Family/Nano 33 BLE/Nano 33 BLE _ Arduino Documentation.html"}}
